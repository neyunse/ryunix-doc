# Introduction

**RyunixJS** is a modern JavaScript framework built to create **fast, lightweight static websites and Single Page Applications (SPAs)** with a strong focus on performance, clarity, and long-term maintainability.

Inspired by tools such as **React, Next.js, Preact, and Vite**, RyunixJS takes a unique approach:  
it is **fully standalone** and **does not depend on React or any external rendering engine**.

This design choice allows RyunixJS to remain:

- Simple and easy to reason about
- Highly customizable
- Stable and maintainable over time

Instead of following existing conventions, RyunixJS introduces its **own reactive system and architecture**, carefully designed to prioritize **performance, stability, and developer freedom**.

## Philosophy

Modern frontend development often comes with unnecessary complexity. Large abstractions, tightly coupled tooling, and constant API changes can slow down development and make long-term maintenance difficult.

RyunixJS was created to offer a cleaner alternative.

Its philosophy is straightforward:

> **Build modern web applications with full control and minimal complexity.**

With RyunixJS, developers benefit from:

- Clear and explicit application logic
- A predictable and consistent development experience
- A solid foundation for long-lived projects

## Why RyunixJS?

### Truly Standalone Architecture

RyunixJS is designed to work independently, without relying on external frameworks or rendering layers.

This results in:

- Greater architectural freedom
- No dependency on third-party lifecycles
- Full ownership of how applications behave and evolve

---

### Lightweight and Performant

By focusing on a minimal core and purpose-built reactivity, RyunixJS delivers:

- Small bundle sizes
- Fast runtime performance
- Efficient static and SPA workflows

This makes it a strong choice for:

- Static websites
- Dashboards and admin panels
- Documentation platforms
- Lightweight web applications

---

### Stability First

Stability is a core principle of RyunixJS.

Instead of frequent disruptive changes, the framework emphasizes:

- Backward-compatible updates
- Incremental improvements
- Carefully optimized internals

This approach ensures your codebase remains reliable and easy to maintain as your project grows.

---

### Deploy Anywhere

RyunixJS is infrastructure-agnostic and works in a wide range of environments.

You can deploy your application:

- On any static hosting provider
- On traditional servers
- On edge platforms
- On custom infrastructures

No special runtimes. No lock-in.
